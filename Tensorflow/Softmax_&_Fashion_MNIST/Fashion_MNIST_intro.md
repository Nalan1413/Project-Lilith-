What is Softmax:

Softmax is an activation function that normalizes a numerical vector into a probability distribution vector, and the sum of each probability is 1. Softmax can be used as the last layer of the neural network for the output of multi-classification problems. Softmax layers are often used in conjunction with the cross-entropy loss function.
